The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS) is a community which develops and applies open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible “Do-It-Yourself” techniques, Public Laboratory creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment.

The core PLOTS program is focused on “civic science” in which we research open source hardware and software tools and methods to generate knowledge and share data about community environmental health. Our goal is to increase the ability of underserved communities to identify, redress, remediate, and create awareness and accountability around environmental concerns. PLOTS achieves this by providing online and offline training, education and support, and by focusing on locally-relevant outcomes that emphasize human capacity and understanding.

INSTALLATION
==========================

You'll need Ruby on Rails ~2.3.15, Ruby 1.8.7 (Ruby 1.9.x doesn't work for now as there is no packaged version of the geohash gem yet for 1.9.x), and GDAL >=1.7.x (gdal.org)
Check the version of ruby installed on your system by "ruby -v" If it displays a version other than 1.8.7, use a version manager like RVM to use ruby 1.8.7 as default.

1) Download source from http://github.com/jywarren/mapknitter
2) Install the compatible (with ruby 1.8.7) versions of the following gems using "gem install" : mysql(2.9.1), geokit-rails(1.1.4), image_science(1.2.6), recaptcha(0.3.6), will_paginate(2.3.16), oa-openid(0.3.2), httparty(0.11.0).
For e.g.- use "gem install geokit-rails -v 1.1.4" to install geokit-rails version 1.1.4. The dependent libraries can be viewed by opening /config/environment.rb.
3) Install davetroy-geohash from github source; first add github source with "gem sources -a http://gems.github.com" then run "gem install davetroy-geohash". (probably not needed anymore really)
4) Manually run "gem install RubyInline" - this was causing trouble when done from environment.rb
5) Install Amazon S3 gem with "gem install aws-s3" if you are using Amazon S3 for most image storage
6) Copy and configure config/database.yml from config/database.yml.example
7) Initialize database with "rake db:migrate"
8) Change the Google Maps API key at config/config.yml, which you can copy from config/config.yml.example. If you're running it locally, you can use the default which is provided; it's set up for http://localhost:3000. For a new one visit http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
9) Enter the ReCaptcha public and private keys in config/initializers/recaptcha.rb, copied from recaptcha.rb.example
10) Remove write permissions from the folder you have placed your app in.
11) Start rails with "script/server -p 3000" or "passenger start -p 3000" from the Rails root and open http://localhost:3000 in a web browser.

BITNAMI INSTALLATION
==========================

This is experimental, but if it works, you'll have a local version which you can carry around on a USB stick. We hope it will be useful for low-bandwidth situations. But beware - it hasn't been tested!

From the Bitnami RubyStack README:
To install BitNami RubyStack you will need:

    - Intel x86 or compatible processor
    - Minimum of 512 MB RAM 
    - Minimum of 150 MB hard drive space
    - TCP/IP protocol support
    - Compatible operantig systems:
      - An x86 Linux operating system.
      - A 32-bit Windows operating system such as Windows 2000, XP, Vista
      or Windows Server 2003.
      - An OS X operating system (PowerPC or x86).

You will also need: 
    - GDAL >= 1.7.x (gdal.org)
    - some source of local tiles, such as from TileStream (mapbox.com)

1) Download the Bitnami.org RubyStack: http://bitnami.org/stack/rubystack, and run the installer.
2) Place this MapKnitter folder in the resulting "projects" folder inside "rubystack-2.2-2" (get MapKnitter at http://github.com/jywarren/mapknitter or https://github.com/jywarren/mapknitter/zipball/master)
3) Open a shell prompt/terminal, and enter the "rubystack-2.2-2" folder.
4) Type ".rubyconsole" to start the Bitnami ruby console.
5) Type "cd projects/mapknitter" to enter the MapKnitter project folder.
6) Follow the above steps for a normal installation.
